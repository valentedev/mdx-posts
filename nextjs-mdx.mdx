# Next.js and MDX files

The best way to have a blog about programming is to use MD files. You can add code snippets, videos and images without depending of an API or database to texts. Today we are going to see how I have created this Blog using Next.js and MDX.

## What is MDX?

- Create a github repository with all your posts;
- Use MDX Remote (compileMDX) to get meta fields from Post files in from Github repo with `getPostByName()`
- Pull the list of file from Github and generate an array of files with `getPostsMeta()`
- Render a list of Posts in
-

Both fields must match

```jsx showLineNumbers title="Some title"
const { frontmatter, content } = await compileMDX<{
    // These files must match github blog posts
    title: string;
    author: string;
    date: string;
    excerpt: string;
    categories: string[];
  }>({
    source: rawMDX,
    options: {
      parseFrontmatter: true,
      mdxOptions: {
        rehypePlugins: [
          rehypeHighlight,
          rehypeSlug,
          [
            rehypeAutolinkHeadings,
            {
              behavior: "wrap",
            },
          ],
        ],
      },
    },
  });
```
